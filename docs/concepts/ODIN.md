# ODIN - On Demand Injection

ODIN - On Demand (prompt|message|history) Injection is the concept of injecting prompt details as needed to solve a particular use case.

For example, a chatbot assistant that knows about your ACME Hats Online store will get an initial prompt of
`You are a store assistant for ACME Hats. You are to be polite, helpful and friendly.`

As the user starts chatting with the bot, if the user asks about `baseball caps`, we can add to the prompt
`We make baseball caps for Hockey, baseball, college football, etc. Min order for little league teams is 24 caps`
