# Applied AI

Take a **concept** such as `Vector Store` to and show a practical **standalone implementation code example** in a specific language:

- `/js` → `Javascript solutions`
- `js/langchain` → `LangChain examples`
- `js/vectorstore` → `VectorStore examples`
- `eCommerce/`→ `Actual examples how AI fits in your eCommerce online shop`

There is some overlap there, but we will do our best to keep verticals clean and easy to pick and choose what applies to you.

## Purpose

Purpose of this site is to show simple examples and FULL examples.

There is nothing more infuriating than not seeing how something fits in the big picture.

## Invitation for "Example Requests"

If you have a specific use case, feel free to ask us to show you how something is done.
Conditions for now are as such:

- example code will be shared with the world free of cost or conditions
- example cannot take us more than (in our assessment) approx 1-2 week worth of effort (that includes the testing, writeup and doc around it)
- we select a use case solely at our discretion
