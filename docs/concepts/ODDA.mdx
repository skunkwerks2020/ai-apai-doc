# ODDA - On Demand Data

On demand Data means to make available contextual data on demand.

A regular knowledge base from a VectorStore is available to the AI at any given time.

For example, if you have a product sales chatbot and want to provide different information on product for East Coast vs West Coast customers, that is only possible with two different DB knowledgebases (and likely with two different chatbots).
